# Machine Learning with TensorFlow 1.x
This is the code repository for [Machine Learning with TensorFlow 1.x](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/machine-learning-tensorflow-1x?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786462961), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Google's TensorFlow is a game changer in the world of machine learning. It has made machine learning faster, simpler, and more accessible than ever before. This book will teach you how to easily get started with machine learning using the power of Python and TensorFlow 1.x.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
batch_size = 128
 num_steps = 10000
 learning_rate = 0.3
 data_showing_step = 500
```

For software, the whole book is based on TensorFlow. You can use either Linux, Windows,
or macOS.

For hardware, you will need a computer or laptop that runs Ubuntu, macOS, or Windows.
As authors, we encourage you to have an NVIDIA graphics card if you want to work with
deep neural networks, especially when you want to work with large-scale datasets.
